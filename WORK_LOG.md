| April 5     |       9-10pm        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| November 15 | 30 Minutes in class |                                                                                                                                                                                               I started implementing my solution involving representing the bitmap as the lengths of sequences of ones and zeros. I finished a draft of the code, but am not getting any output. |
| November 18 |      8:00-8:15      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I spent this time trying to debug. I think I solved one issue in which I was using the readString( |
| November 19 |     11:15-11:45     |                                                                                                                                             I spent this time debugging my code. I found one issue in which I wasn't adding the final bit to the length of each run, which got me a largely correct algorithm. However, the code still end with the q offsett in the final file. |
| November 19 |     11:45-12:05     |                                                                                                                                                                      I couldn't figure out the problem, but I solved an issue with part of the header file being included in the final file. I think the issue has something to do with the length of each series being one off. |
| November 19 |     7:00 - 7:45     |                                                           I finally fixed the errors in my code. There were two main errors that were leading to the offset and to extra bits being added at the end. I solved the first error by setting localMax to 0 initially and then setting it to one after each cycle. I solved the other issue by skipping the final character in data. |
| November 20 |      8:45-8:55      |                                                                                                                                                         Added comments to the code. I also realized I was adding one to the number of bits needed to represent an integer for no reason which makes my code slightly more efficient, with a compression ratio of just under 20%. |
| November 22 |     11:25-11:55     |                                                                                                                    I started coding the algorithm to experimentally determine the optimal number of bits to display each integer and I think I may have achieved the highest compression ratio in the class. As of now, it is sitting at about 5000%. I will debug next session. |
| November 27 |      6:05-6:35      | I found and fixed an error with the compression of the data where I wasn't properly tracking the length of the sequence by just using a try and catch block in the expand function. It probably isn't the most efficient method, but it works. For some reason, using the findOptimalLength function makes the compression not work, but I couldn't get to that in this session. |
| November 29 |     11:00-11:30     |                     I found the error in the find optimal, I left in a BinaryStdOut line that was adding to the file every time I called it. The algorithm works to find the optimal length in mystery, but I think that's because the optimal length is the default value I calculated. There must be some error with the algorithm because it overestimates in bigMystery.bin. |
| December 1  |      4:30-4:15      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Made sure simplified, assume eight 8 bit solution is working and added comments to code. I'll continue working on more complex solution later. |
