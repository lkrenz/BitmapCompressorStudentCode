| November 15 | 30 Minutes in class |                                                   I started implementing my solution involving representing the bitmap as the lengths of sequences of ones and zeros. I finished a draft of the code, but am not getting any output. |

| November 19 |     11:15-11:45     | I spent this time debugging my code. I found one issue in which I wasn't adding the final bit to the length of each run, which got me a largely correct algorithm. However, the code still end with the q offsett in the final file. |
| November 19 |     11:45-12:05     |                          I couldn't figure out the problem, but I solved an issue with part of the header file being included in the final file. I think the issue has something to do with the length of each series being one off. |
