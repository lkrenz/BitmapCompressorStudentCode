| April 5     |       9-10pm        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| November 15 | 30 Minutes in class |                                                                                                                                     I started implementing my solution involving representing the bitmap as the lengths of sequences of ones and zeros. I finished a draft of the code, but am not getting any output. |
| November 18 |      8:00-8:15      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I spent this time trying to debug. I think I solved one issue in which I was using the readString( |
| November 19 |     11:15-11:45     |                                                                                   I spent this time debugging my code. I found one issue in which I wasn't adding the final bit to the length of each run, which got me a largely correct algorithm. However, the code still end with the q offsett in the final file. |
| November 19 |     11:45-12:05     |                                                                                                            I couldn't figure out the problem, but I solved an issue with part of the header file being included in the final file. I think the issue has something to do with the length of each series being one off. |
| November 19 |     7:00 - 7:45     | I finally fixed the errors in my code. There were two main errors that were leading to the offset and to extra bits being added at the end. I solved the first error by setting localMax to 0 initially and then setting it to one after each cycle. I solved the other issue by skipping the final character in data. |
| November 20 |      8:45-8:55      |                                                                                               Added comments to the code. I also realized I was adding one to the number of bits needed to represent an integer for no reason which makes my code slightly more efficient, with a compression ratio of just under 20%. |
| November 22 |     11:25-11:55     |                                                          I started coding the algorithm to experimentally determine the optimal number of bits to display each integer and I think I may have achieved the highest compression ratio in the class. As of now, it is sitting at about 5000%. I will debug next session. |
